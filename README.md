# high-leverage-rows
Code to compute high leverage rows by finding locally high leverage rows.

When computing an orthonormal basis we can use threshold of d / block_size for every threshold.

For an \ell_1 wcb we need to use d^1.5 / block_size

### Usage:

1. Run `main_script.m`
2. Run `uniform_sampling.m`
3. Run `Plots for census experiments.ipynb`
